NAME
    Log::Dispatch::ArrayWithLimits - Log to array, with some limits applied

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.01 of Log::Dispatch::ArrayWithLimits
    (from Perl distribution Log-Dispatch-ArrayWithLimits), released on
    2014-07-06.

SYNOPSIS
     use Log::Dispatch::ArrayWithLimits;

     my $file = Log::Dispatch::ArrayWithLimits(
         min_level     => 'info',
         array         => $ary,    # default: []
         max_elems     => 100,     # defaults unlimited
     );

     $file->log(level => 'info', message => "Your comment\n");

DESCRIPTION
    This module functions similarly to Log::Dispatch::Array, except that
    only the messages are stored and there are some limits applied
    (currently only the maximum number of elements in the array).

    Logging to an in-process array can be useful when debugging/testing, or
    when you want to let users of your program connect to your program to
    request viewing the ogs being produced.

METHODS
  new(%args)
    Constructor. This method takes a hash of parameters. The following
    options are valid: "min_level" and "max_level" (see Log::Dispatch
    documentation); "array", "max_elems".

  log_message(message => STR)
    Send a message to the appropriate output. Generally this shouldn't be
    called directly but should be called through the "log()" method (in
    LLog::Dispatch::Output>).

TODO
    max_total_len

    max_age
