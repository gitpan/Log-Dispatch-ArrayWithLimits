NAME
    Log::Dispatch::ArrayWithLimits - Log to array, with some limits applied

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.02 of Log::Dispatch::ArrayWithLimits
    (from Perl distribution Log-Dispatch-ArrayWithLimits), released on
    2014-07-06.

SYNOPSIS
     use Log::Dispatch::ArrayWithLimits;

     my $file = Log::Dispatch::ArrayWithLimits(
         min_level     => 'info',
         array         => $ary,    # default: [], you can always refer by name e.g. 'My::array' to refer to @My::array
         max_elems     => 100,     # defaults unlimited
     );

     $file->log(level => 'info', message => "Your comment\n");

DESCRIPTION
    This module functions similarly to Log::Dispatch::Array, with a few
    differences:

    *   only the messages (strings) are stored

    *   allow specifying array variable name (e.g. "My::array" instead of
        \@My:array)

        This makes it possible to use in Log::Log4perl configuration, which
        is a text file.

    *   can apply some limits

        Currently only max_elems (the maximum number of elements in the
        array) is available. Future limits will be added (see "TODO").

    Logging to an in-process array can be useful when debugging/testing, or
    when you want to let users of your program connect to your program to
    request viewing the ogs being produced.

METHODS
  new(%args)
    Constructor. This method takes a hash of parameters. The following
    options are valid: "min_level" and "max_level" (see Log::Dispatch
    documentation); "array" (a reference to an array, or if value is string,
    will be taken as name of array variable; this is so this module can be
    used/configured e.g. by Log::Log4perl because configuration is specified
    via a text file), "max_elems".

  log_message(message => STR)
    Send a message to the appropriate output. Generally this shouldn't be
    called directly but should be called through the "log()" method (in
    LLog::Dispatch::Output>).

TODO
    max_total_len

    max_age
